      "* In *declarative languages*, you write a specification that describes the problem to be solved, and the language implementation figures out how to perform the computation efficiently. SQL is the declarative language you\u2019re most likely to be familiar with; a SQL query describes the data set you want to retrieve, and the SQL engine decides whether to scan tables or use indexes, which subclauses should be performed first, etc.\n",
      "* *Object-oriented programs* manipulate collections of objects. Objects have internal state and support methods that query or modify this internal state in some way. Smalltalk and Java are object-oriented languages. C++ and Python are languages that support object-oriented programming, but don\u2019t force the use of object-oriented features.\n",
      "* *Functional programming* decomposes a problem into a set of functions. Ideally, functions only take inputs and produce outputs, and don\u2019t have any internal state that affects the output produced for a given input. Well-known functional languages include the ML family (Standard ML, OCaml, and other variants) and Haskell."
